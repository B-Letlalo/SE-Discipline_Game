__Task 3: Compare and contrast the switch statement with nested if-else statements,highlighting scenarios where each is more suitable__

__What are the key differences of switch statements and if-else statements__
Both these statements are control flow structures that evaluate conditions and make decisions based on them.
The main difference is the syntax

__Compare and contrast the statements.__
A switch statement is more suitable when you have a single variable that needs 
to be evaluated through multiple conditions.
An if-else statement is more suitable when each condition evaluated and met has
has it's own set of actions to execute.
